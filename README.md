# Imageless
A collection of resources on how to use the internet without images.

## Welcome to Imageless!
Here you will find resources on how to enjoy the internet without ads, GIFs, images, pictures, videos, etc.

## Why?
You may want your browser to be imageless for one or more reasons below:
- Distractions: Maybe you're working, studying for a test, reading a book, or watching a movie. 
- Inappropriate Content: Maybe you're protecting yourself or your children.
- Privacy: Maybe you're fighting advertisers, marketers, scammers.
- Speed: Maybe you just want the internet to run faster.

## How?
I am slowly collecting tutorials on how to do this. At this time, I will just have a table with links to show how to disable images on various platforms and websites. Please check them out in [Resources](https://github.com/MacroGrove/Imageless/blob/main/Resources.md).
